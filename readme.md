# Vectors lib
Simple lib implementing vec2, vec3, vec4 from Litemath (C++)

Don't want to write shaders in webgl/webgpu, but want to render something in canvas? This simple library provides some vectors and functions you can work with

## Functions

Added some functions to work with vectors, maybe it will be updated later...

Current list of functions:
1. add(vector, vector) / add(vector, number) / add(number, vector)
2. sub(vector, vector) / sub(vector, number) / sub(number, vector)
3. mul(vector, vector) / mul(vector, number) / mul(number, vector)
4. div(vector, vector) / div(vector, number) / div(number, vector)
5. greater(vector, vector)
6. less(vector, vector)
7. greaterOrEqual(vector, vector)
8. lessOrEqual(vector, vector)
9. equal(vector, vector)
10. notEqual(vector, vector)
11. min(vector, vector)
12. max(vector, vector)
13. clamp(vector, vector, vector) / clampVec(vector, number, number)
14. abs(vector)
15. lerp(vector, vector, number)
16. mix(vector, vector, number)
17. sqrt(vector)
18. dot(vector, vector)
19. lengthVec(vector)
20. normalize(vector)
